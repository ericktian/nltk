paper1 = '''	Ever since The Revolutionary War, the United States has vowed to stray away from the monarchy that it fought so hard to get away from. One of the methods to maintain a democracy has been to ensure limited political terms for a vast majority of positions, which was established in the Articles of Confederation, where the precedent was set when George Washington left office after only two terms to avoid dying in office. This has ensured that no one leader stays in power for too long, and the two-party American system ensures that there is constant opposition to unpopular positions which holds politicians responsible for making sure their ideas are publicly popular.
	However, this is not true in all areas of the world. For example, the United Kingdom still reigns under a monarchy, countries such as Russia have political leaders who have ruled for over a decade, and other countries such as Cameroon have unlimited presidential terms. Because of the lack of limits in certain countries, authoritarian leaders often come from countries with a lack of those restrictions.
	In the case of China, Deng Xiaoping originally added the limit to the constitution to prevent his successors from staying indefinitely. “Under Mr. Jiang and later Mr. Hu, a new norm formed. The top leader had clear authority because he held all three main posts. But he had to hand them to a successor after about a decade.” This led to the most stable recent transitions of power in China, from President Jiang to President Hu to President Xi. Since this rule is now abolished, this raises the question of what should be accepted by the world in terms of political authority in countries, which is especially relevant for China due to their political power strong economy.
	Although this change in Chinese precedent has been long overreached in other areas of the world, there is no bright line for what is deemed a government representative of the people, nor is there a clear threshold for when the rest of the world should intervene with seemingly authoritarian regimes. In addition, there is no clear definition for what constitutes an unjust government, as different countries have different interpretations. 
But since Xi is currently popular in China, there was little objection to the almost unanimous vote to abolish the term limit. However, I think that this is a bad idea, since although Xi is popular in China and the people don’t object to his term extension, this sets a precedent for what is expected of presidential terms in the future. In the future, if an unpopular leader were to be elected, the people would now expect his term to last possibly indefinitely, which could lead to a long regime in China’s one-party system since there would be a lack of structural opposition at the party level. Furthermore, this could set an additional precedent that the president would be able to drastically modify the current Chinese Constitution in the way that Xi did on Sunday. This is problematic as Xi’s nearly unanimous vote to remove the presidency term limit demonstrates that The National People’s Congress has no problem setting new precedents.
In addition, with Xi currently holding so much power in office, people opposed to his policies may be silenced, as they see Xi’s presidency as having been largely unchallenged, which would prevent the opposition from easily gaining a large following. This is especially true for the current state of China, as Xi currently holds all three of the strongest positions in political office.
Despite my opinion about the future of China, I don’t think that the rest of the world should be held responsible for intervening now. Since Xi is popular now within the People’s Republic of China and our relations with China are mixed at the moment, we should hold off intervening. Also, “ending the presidential term limit does not ‘imply a system of lifelong leadership.’” This means that although Xi is aiming to lead for more than two terms, this does not necessarily set the foundation for all future presidents to hold an extended period in office. Plus, if the US were to intervene somewhere in the world, there are other places that are worse off in terms of presidential authority. Since China is currently not receiving great amounts of domestic backlash and the unlimited term policy has not been around for long enough to evaluate its effect on Chinese presidential authority, foreign intervention right now is not necessary, although it may be needed later if the circumstances were to change.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) may offer a source of renewable energy that is less expensive than traditional silicon solar cells.  A DSSC uses photoexcitation of an organic sensitizer dye to transfer electrons through a circuit via titanium dioxide nanoparticles. An electrolyte is critical to replenishing the electrons in the dye, thus allowing the cell to continue functioning. Prior research has shown that different types of electrolytes- solid, liquid, and gel- modulate the electrical output of DSSCs. This study compared potato, lemon juice, and Signa electrode gel as solid, liquid, and gel electrolytes, respectively, in comparison to a liquid electrolyte control, iodine. We found that although Signa gel produced the single greatest voltage output, lemon juice produced the highest consistent voltage. The effectiveness of such an inexpensive household material as an electrolyte could be important for building low-cost DSSCs in third-world countries or other areas where electricity would otherwise be too expensive to generate. 














Introduction
As climate change continues to accelerate, the need to move away from fossil fuels has increased. While dependency on fossil fuels is increasing, our supply is continuously depleting. However, in this influx of new available sources, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are innovatively striking. They are a clean, renewable, energy source and are extremely applicable in our modern world. A DSSC, is a highly effective type of solar cell that is cheap, efficient, and easily made. These cells transform light energy into chemical energy through a process similar to photosynthesis (Trimarchi, 2009). Since they are extremely cheap and easy to make, they can be applied in a variety of scenarios. For example, DSSCs are more thin and transparent than other types of photovoltaic cells, they can be installed in windows for an effective and innovative source of energy (Ondrey, 2014).
Since these cells are designed to duplicate the process of photosynthesis, they are relatively inexpensive and work continuously. DSSCs are thin glass films designed to capture light and convert it to electrical energy. They are typically transparent and consist of two pieces of conductive glass with an oxide, a dye, carbon and an electrolyte in between. First, light energy is absorbed by the photosensitive outer layer of conductive glass. Then, those electrons are transferred to the dye where they become excited and build up on the oxide layer. This excitement of electrons by light is called photoexcitation (Hagfeld, 2012). The electron travels through the titanium dioxide to the cathode (the carbon) where it then is transferred back to the electrolyte solution. The electrolyte solution replenished the electron lost by the organic dye – then it too needs to be replenished. (Trimarchi, 2009). The process by which a DSSC produces electricity is similar to the process of photosynthesis in a plant cell (James, 2015). A plant cell relies on photoexcitation of the chlorophyll pigment to pass electrons through a chain of proteins to eventually make glucose- a basic sugar- and ATP- a form of chemical energy. The chlorophyll performs the same function as the dye in a DSSC (James 2015). Since the electrolyte is responsible for replenishing the lost electron from the organic dye, they play a significant role in the functionality and repetitive process of a DSSC (Trimarchi, 2009). 
Since research on DSSCs first began, three major types of electrolytes have evolved: liquid, solid, and quasi-solid/ gel electrolytes (Mehmood, Rahman, Harrabi, Hussein, and Reddy, 2014). Liquid electrolytes are the oldest and most commonly used in DSSCs because they convert a large percentage of available light energy into electrical energy. However, they limit the durability of a DSSC because they are volatile and prone to evaporation or leakage (Singh,  Kim, and Rhee, 2009). Solid-state electrolytes are more durable, but less efficient because they have less surface area of contact with the electrode, meaning not as many electrons pass through to the electrode (Mehmood, Rahman, Harrabi, Hussein, and Reddy, 2014).  Gel polymer electrolytes appear to be a compromise with these two. They are made up of a liquid electrolyte trapped in a polymer network to prevent leakage (Mehmood, Rahman, Harrabi, Hussein, and Reddy, 2014).  Singh, Kim, and Rhee’s experiment (2009) used this type of polymer electrolyte, with an ionic liquid contained in a solid polymer membrane. Polymer electrolytes result in a low rate of leakage, comparable conductivity to liquid electrolytes, and good surface contact with the electrode (Mehmood, Rahman, Harrabi, Hussein, and Reddy, 2014; Singh,  Kim, and Rhee, 2009). 
Based on these prior studies, we tested whether or not gel polymer electrolytes could be the best compromise for use in a DSSC. To do this we devised an experiment testing the effects of electrolytes with different consistencies on the energy efficiency. We found that lemon juice had the greatest consistency at a mean of 0.17 volts generated, with iodine following closely behind with a mean of 0.16 volts generated. Signa gel had the overall best individual measurement, at 0.24 volts. However, it was extremely inconsistent with a mean of 0.14 volts. Lastly, mashed potatoes conducted very little with a mean of 0.01 volts. These data suggest that the type of electrolyte used in DSSCs could be either a liquid or gel, but not a solid. Gels produce better individual results with less consistency, while liquids produce slightly high, more consistent results. 

Materials and Methods
Assembly of the anode
This experiment used two 1”x 2” conductive glass plates as the electrodes. The first plate, the anode, was covered with a layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2). Using a pipette, 4 drops of the TiO2 were placed on each anode, and spread with tweezers. After about fifteen minutes, the anode was placed on a hot plate at 430°C for approximately 60 minutes until it dried completely and converted to a white shade. The following day, it was immersed in blackberry dye for 30 minutes.

Assembly of the cathode 
A second conductive glass plate was used as the cathode. An open flame was held under the conductive side of each cathode, applying a black carbon layer.

Application of the electrolyte
Next, the electrolyte substance was applied to cover the carbon layer. For the first cell, 5 drops of reconstituted lemon juice were poured onto the cathode and spread with the flat part of plastic tweezers. For the second cell, a layer of mashed redskin potato was smeared over the glass plate, again using tweezers. The third cell was covered with 3 drops of Signa Electrolyte Gel. Finally, the iodine electrolyte was spread over the fourth (control) cell.

Assembling the anode and cathode
The completed anode and cathode were stacked with the conductive sides facing each other, and they were held together with binder clips. The two plates were offset so that alligator clips could later be attached.

Voltage measurements
The completed DSSCs were held approximately 12 inches from a fluorescent growth light for close to 5 minutes in order to get a voltage reading. Alligator clips were attached to each electrode of the DSSCs, and voltage was measured in direct current using a multimeter. After obtaining a reading, each DSSC was placed away from the light for roughly one minute before the next trial.

Statistical analysis
The results of this study were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA Test. The test was performed with a threshold level of significance of 0.05. 


Results

Our results showed that the lemon juice produced the highest average voltage  reading (0.17 V), as seen in Table 1. With the exception of the potato, which only produced 0.01 volts on every reading, the lemon juice also gave the most consistent voltage, with a standard deviation of 0.033. The average voltage reading of the iodide control electrolyte was only slightly less than the lemon juice (average of 0.16 V versus 0.17 V, respectively); however, the voltage readings from the DSSC with the iodide electrolyte dropped precipitously from the first reading to the last, indicating poor durability. The Signa gel gave the highest voltage of all the cells, with the highest reading of 0.24 V. However, the Signa gel was also the least consistent, with a standard deviation of  0.12V. Also, the voltage output of the DSSC using the Signa gel electrolyte decreased drastically after the second reading. The voltage readings for every electrolyte, supporting the point that lemon juice gave the highest and most consistent voltage readings are shown in figure 1. 
Discussion
	The goal of this experiment was to observe effects that the applied electrolyte could have on the conductance of the DSSC. Since the electrolyte plays a crucial role in the electron cycle within a DSSC by replenishing lost electrons in the dye (Trimarchi, 2009), the conductance and reliability of many electrolytes must be tested to see which is more applicable. In this experiment, several possible effective electrolytes were tested: iodine, lemon juice, mashed potatoes, and signa gel, with iodine as a control. Despite the hypothesis that signa gel would conduct most effectively, it was found that both lemon juice and iodine had conducted better than signa gel, and mashed potatoes did not conduct at all--most likely due to its solid state (Kalaignan, Kang, & Kang, 2006). Signa gel had the highest conductance, but the results were extremely inconsistent. This may have been due to human error or other reasons, however, it was still unexpected to see that iodine, the control, had performed better than almost all of the other electrolytes.
	Lemon juice is not only more conductive than iodine, but it is also much cheaper and more readily available. Because of this, it can be used in greater quantities with much better results. However, the acidity of lemon juice could cause potential problems, including corrosion and other harmful effects to the DSSC. Although this will only occur from long term use, DSSCs are built for continuous functionality which an acidic electrolyte may prevent. Still, an inexpensive and accessible electrolyte would be extremely applicable in situations where DSSCs are needed in a large amount to supply for a needy power source. In addition, DSSCs are also applicable to common items, such as windows and sunglasses, for an auxiliary source of energy (Trimarchi, 2009). DSSCs are applicable to a variety of situations, and finding a suitable electrolyte would be just the first step to creating the ideal solar cell.
In conclusion, our results point to the idea that manipulating the electrolytes plays a role in the performance of the dye-sensitized solar cells. In third world countries where obtaining a cheap source of electricity is the issue, this small solar cell will make a big difference. Although lemon juice ultimately performed better and more consistently, the acidity of the substance could be potentially harmful to DSSC performance. A future experiment could test the long-term effects as well as the conductance of substances with extreme pHs.
